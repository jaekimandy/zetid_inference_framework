We aim to implement an ML framework intended for neural network inference. Please
define the necessary variables and functions for a neural network interface and provide an
example code demonstrating how the defined interface would be used.
While we prefer C++, you may use Python if you find it significantly challenging to
implement in C++. Given equivalent results, we favor candidates who implement in C++.
You are not required to fully implement all functions, but please include comments that
describe the necessary logic.
Additionally, explaining your intent behind the design choices for variables and functions
will be helpful for reviewing your submission.
